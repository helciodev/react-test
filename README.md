# [Refresh Studio]: React Test

## Overview 
This test aims to access your React.js abilities and comfort with the core concepts of the framework. We expect you to develop a functional one-page site that meets the framework's principles (componentization, re-usability). 

## Task 
- You are tasked to develop the site following [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/j5mc2Vl9LvAuHnK1q5ly4y/Smart-Crypto-Wallet-Landing-Page-UI-UX-Responsive-Design-(Community)?node-id=1%3A2), you should make sure that you: 
- You should use a modern React.js template framework (cra, next, gatsby)
- Your site is fully responsive
- You add animations to your components.

##  What we will be looking at
- Componentization
- Code cleanness
- Re-usability
- Accessibility
- Implementation
